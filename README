1. INTRODUCTION
---------------
This plugin helps to develop applications with calendar capabilities. This includes:
- creation of calendars with customised colors
- creation of events dragging on the calendar (in the month, week and day views)
- basic ical export
- json export

2. INSTALLATION
---------------
   grails install-plugin events-calendar

It depends on jquery, jquery-ui, and full-calendar plugin

3. QUICKSTART
-------------
Two Domain classes are created: 'Calendar' and 'Event'. Once the plugin installed and the server fired up go to url:
http://myserver:port/events-calendar/calendar (most likely http://localhost:8080/events-calendar/calendar will work) for a list of calendars

You can of course create calendars and then create events by dragging/clicking on the calendar display. So far modifying events by dragging does not work yet

if you want to connect (in read only mode) to your favorite calendar using ical standard, use the following link:
http://myserver:port/events-calendar/calendar/ical/${your_calendar_id}

for json connection, use the following link:
http://myserver:port/events-calendar/calendar/json/${your_calendar_id}?start="number of seconds from 01-01-1970"&end="number of seconds from 01-01-1970"
You'll get the events between "start" and "end" dates in json format following the fullcalendar schema: http://arshaw.com/fullcalendar/docs/event_data/Event_Object/
Usually the java System.CurrentTimeMillis()/1000 provides a good start as for "start" and "end" values


Enjoy!
