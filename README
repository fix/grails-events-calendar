INTRODUCTION
------------

This plugin helps to develop applications with calendar capabilities.

INSTALLATION
------------

   grails install-plugin events-calendar

It depends on jquery, jquery-ui, and full-calendar plugin

QUICKSTART
----------

Two Domain classes are created 'Calendar' and 'Event'. Once the plugin installed and the server fired up go to url:
http://myserver:port/events-calendar/calendar (most probably http://localhost:8080/events-calendar/calendar ) for a list of calendars

You can of course create calendars and then create events by dragging/clicking on the calendar display. So far modifying events by dragging does not work yet


Enjoy!
